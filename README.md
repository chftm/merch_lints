# Merch Lints

A set of linter rules for Dart and Flutter used by
[flexagoon](https://flexagoon.com/) and [chftm](https://github.com/chftm).

This package combines rules from
[very_good_analysis](https://pub.dev/packages/very_good_analysis) and
[dart_code_metrics](https://dcm.dev) and tweaks a few defaults.

## Usage

Add this package as a dev dependency:

```sh
dart pub add dev:merch_lints
```

Include the package in your `analysis_options.yaml`:

```yml
include: package:merch_lints/analysis_options.yaml
```
